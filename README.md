# uno
Uno on console. Need anything else? 
Oh and by console I mean computer console, the command prompt on Windows or Terminal on Linux and MacOS, not... game console like PS4 
and XB1 or the Switch (can I actually make it into a full program?) 

Anyways, enjoy the game when it's done, which will probably take a while

Rated M: 
- Explicit language
- Edgy jokes (that might be offensive)
- Copyrighted memes according to Article 13 

- Everything above is exaggregated, it's not as bad as it seems, only have a couple jokes from Vanoss and the crew. Some from our lord
